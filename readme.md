#### Demo project for GapJumpers / Return Path

Submitted by Doug Riblet on April 1, 2017

Deployed to Heroku: <https://strawberry-shortcake-73940.herokuapp.com/>

Style notes: I used a linter called Standard which enforces a no-semicolons JavaScript style. I like Standard's simplicity and strictness and have used it on several recent projects. However, I'm not committed to this no-semicolons approach and would be happy to use different rules on the job.
